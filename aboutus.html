<h2>About New Hites Technology</h2>
<h3>Our Brief History</h3>
<p>New Hites Technology was founded in June of 2016 as project on the side by Adrian K Companies. The ideas was to keep a non-profit software developer, but that plan changed. Our current CEO, Adrian, decided to leave Adrian K Companies, the investment concern he had founded to become a tech executive. Plans changed and New Hites was now a regular company. 
<p></p>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>We simply focus on developing smart and efficient educational apps and programs with knowledge and learning as the base of our development. We are currently most active in the field of mathematics, with calculators as primary objects.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>We plan to continue to develope apps as we do right now, with education as our basis. But we also have projects that will approach certain audiences and a project called "Essentials", both of which you'll se more of later in 2016.</p>
